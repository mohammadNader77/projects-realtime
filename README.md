# ENCS4330 - Real-Time Applications & Embedded Systems

This repository contains the source code and simulations for the three projects under the **ENCS4330 - Real-Time Applications & Embedded Systems** course, at **Birzeit University**, Faculty of Engineering and Technology. Below are the details of each project.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Bungee Jumping Game Simulation

- **Description**: A multi-processing application simulating a bungee jumping game using signals and pipes in Linux. Three teams of players compete, with each player’s energy decreasing based on their actions.
- **Objective**: To simulate team dynamics, random energy changes, and manage a referee’s role in controlling the game.
- **Key Technologies**: Multi-processing, Signals, Pipes, OpenGL for graphics.

### Project 2: File Management Simulation

- **Description**: A multi-processing simulation where file generators create CSV files, and calculators compute averages while moving processed files. Inspectors handle unprocessed and old files.
- **Objective**: To simulate the creation, processing, and movement of CSV files, while utilizing IPC techniques to manage communication between processes.
- **Key Technologies**: Multi-processing, Inter-process Communication (IPC), OpenGL for graphics.

### Project 3: Counter Espionage Agency Simulation

- **Description**: A multi-threading and multi-processing simulation of a counter-espionage agency protecting resistance groups. The simulation includes spies, resistance members, and counter espionage agents.
- **Objective**: To simulate the dynamics between resistance groups and espionage activities, including potential arrests of spies and agency members.
- **Key Technologies**: Multi-processing, Multi-threading, OpenGL for graphics.

## Requirements

- **Linux OS** (For testing and running the code)
- **gcc**: Compiler for C programs.
- **OpenGL**: For graphics representation.
- **Python** (for certain simulation handling, if applicable).
- **gdb**: For debugging the code.
- **CMake**: For building and compiling projects.
